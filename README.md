# PomodoroApp With Python
A minimalistic user friendly Pomodoro timer desktop application. 
Now go pomodoro your way through stressful assignments and tasks!! :)

## Description
So, this is what Wikipedia tells us about the Pomodoro Technique

There are six steps in the original technique of Pomodoro:  
1)Decide on the task to be done.  
2)Set the pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).  
3)Work on the task.  
4)End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a piece of paper.  
5)If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break (3–5 minutes), then go to step 2.  
6)After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15–30 minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.  

Most implementations of this application is predominantly in JS, Java or C. I decided to make an application with Python.
The GUI part was built with the help of tkinter module in python. This can be run as a desktop application. (Unix/Linux/MacOS)


### To Do/Future Plans:  
1) Intend to create feature to allow user defined Pomodoro intervals for break and work sessions.  
2) Make GUI more vibrant and smooth
3) Favourite Idea is to create a feature that also stores the tasks to be done! 0__0
4) Overcome and research more about the diffiulties I faced while developing the application in MacOS due to lot of compatibility issues between tkinter, pygame, mac interface, anaconda. T_T
